Image location for portable haggu viewer use

RIP MrHaggu

I don't have that many pics of my old cats so you'd see me re-using the same pics everytime. I refuse to use anything other than my cat pics as placeholders,
and when they look so good, might as well make them the real pic instead of just the place holder. Thank you for reading this.
